# Contexts

Android Context is normally required to construct widgets, check screen orientation, etc.
However, one has to [differentiate between](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/987072/using-application-context-everywhere?rq=1)
two types of context: one obtained from an activity
and one obtained from the application. The reason is that holding on to the activity context
may cause [memory leaks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3346080/android-references-to-a-context-and-memory-leaks).

Macroid automatically stores `Activity` and `Service` contexts as weak references, avoiding the problem.
This is done with the `ContextWrapper` trait, which has four methods:

* `contextWrapper.application` will return the application context;
* `contextWrapper.original` will return a weak reference to the original context passed to `ContextWrapper`;
* `contextWrapper.getOriginal` is the same as above, but it will force the weak reference;
* `contextWrapper.bestAvailable` will return the original context if it’s available,
  otherwise — the application context.

There are a few specialized cases of `ContextWrapper`: `ActivityContextWrapper`, `ServiceContextWrapper`,
`ApplicationContextWrapper` and `GenericContextWrapper`.

## Including

To include the implicit context in your activity, inherit `Contexts`:

```scala
import macroid.Contexts

class MyActivity extends Activity with Contexts[Activity] {
  ...
}
```

If you use fragments from the support library
(see the [section on fragments](Fragments.html)):

```scala
class MyActivity extends FragmentActivity with Contexts[FragmentActivity] {
  ...
}
```

In a fragment (either `android.app.Fragment` or `android.support.v4.app.Fragment`):

```scala
class MyFragment extends Fragment with Contexts[Fragment] {
  ...
}
```

Finally, if you want to include the implicit context in your views:

```scala
class MyFrameLayout extends FrameLayout with Contexts[View] {
  ...
}
```

You can also construct a `ContextWrapper` directly:

```scala
val ctx = ContextWrapper(myActivity)
```

## Usage

Most Macroid APIs require an implicit `ContextWrapper`. If you use them inside an
activity or a fragment, you are golden. However sometimes you need to pass the context
to other methods:

```scala
import macroid.ContextWrapper
import macroid.FullDsl._
import macroid.contrib._

def customTweak(implicit ctx: ContextWrapper) =
  TextTweaks.large +
  text("foo")

def customLayout(implicit ctx: ContextWrapper) =
  l[LinearLayout](
    w[TextView],
    w[Button]
  )
```

You can also require a specific type of context:

```scala
import macroid.ActivityContextWrapper

def needActivity(implicit ctx: ActivityContextWrapper) =
  ctx.original.get foreach { activity: Activity ⇒
    ...
  }
```
